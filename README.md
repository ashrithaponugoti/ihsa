The Intercollegiate Horse Show Association (IHSA) project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for managing and organizing intercollegiate horse shows. The purpose of this project is to streamline the entire process of hosting and participating in horse shows for college-level equestrian teams. The project will benefit both the organizers of the shows and the participating teams by automating various tasks and providing a centralized system for managing the events.
